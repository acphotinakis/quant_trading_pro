ðŸš€ Project Phases â€“ Quant Trading Pro
Phase 1 â€“ Research & Scoping
* Define project objectives (stock ranking via liquidity, volatility, trendiness).
* Finalize universe (S&P 500 â†’ later expansion).
* Document constraints: data providers, compute/storage, budget.
* Define success metrics (sharpe, hit rate, turnover-adjusted returns).

Phase 2 â€“ Data Acquisition & Infrastructure
* Source & Pipeline Setup:
    * Connect APIs (IB, Yahoo, Alpaca, FMP).
    * Store intraday 5-min OHLCV data (10 years).
* Infrastructure:
    * Efficient storage format (Parquet, DuckDB).
    * Version control of datasets (Git LFS, DVC).
    * Caching + refresh logic.

Phase 3 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Liquidity: Dollar vol, turnover, Amihud (bar & daily).
* Volatility: Realized vol, skew, kurtosis.
* Trendiness: Rolling slope, Hurst, PCA, spectral.
* Deliverables: Plots, distributions, regime analysis, feature library.
* Outcome: Feature candidates + intuition on which metrics are robust.

Phase 4 â€“ Feature Engineering & Selection
* Build daily feature set across all stocks.
* Normalize/cross-sectionally rank features.
* Test stability across rolling windows.
* Select features that are predictive but stable.
* Document feature correlations (avoid redundancy).

Phase 5 â€“ Modeling & Signal Development
* Start simple (logistic/linear regression, gradient boosting).
* Progress to more advanced ML (random forests, XGBoost, LSTMs if needed).
* Use cross-sectional ranking objective rather than absolute prediction.
* Train/test split by time (no lookahead).
* Output: daily stock scores & rankings.

Phase 6 â€“ Transaction Cost & Execution Modeling
* Implement Amihud-based slippage model.
* Estimate costs across liquidity buckets.
* Build position sizing rules (avoid illiquid names).
* Simulate realistic fill assumptions.

Phase 7 â€“ Backtesting Framework
* Build backtest engine (daily rebalance, multi-day horizons).
* Track portfolio metrics: returns, Sharpe, drawdowns, turnover.
* Stress-test across market regimes (2008, 2020, 2022).
* Include transaction cost deductions.

Phase 8 â€“ Validation & Robustness Checks
* Out-of-sample testing.
* Walk-forward validation.
* Feature decay analysis (does predictive power fade?).
* Sensitivity tests (different rebalance frequencies, horizons).
* Cross-check against benchmarks (S&P 500, sector ETFs).

Phase 9 â€“ Deployment / Productionization
* Automate daily data refresh.
* Run model â†’ generate stock rankings.
* Store results in database (Postgres/Supabase).
* Create dashboard for visualization (Next.js frontend).

Phase 10 â€“ Monitoring & Iteration
* Daily monitoring of feature behavior & strategy PnL.
* Drift detection (feature distributions shift?).
* Continuous retraining schedule.
* Research extensions (expand to mid-caps, other markets, alt-data).
