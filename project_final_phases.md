Perfect â€” letâ€™s lock down **Phase 1 (Research & Scoping)** into a clear deliverable plan, the same way we structured EDA. This will serve as the **foundation** for everything else.

---

# ğŸ“‘ Phase 1 â€“ Research & Scoping Plan

### **1. Objectives & Scope Definition**

* **Deliverables:**

  * `docs/project_objectives.md` â†’ plain-English statement of project goals.

    * Predict daily stock rankings based on liquidity, volatility, and trendiness.
    * Horizon: multi-day (e.g., 3â€“10 trading days).
    * Market: US equities (start with S&P 500, later expansion).
    * Constraints: retail compute + API limits.
  * `config/success_metrics.yaml` â†’ structured file listing evaluation metrics:

    * Primary: Sharpe ratio, turnover-adjusted Sharpe.
    * Secondary: max drawdown, hit rate, feature stability.

---

### **2. Universe Selection**

* **Deliverables:**

  * `data/universe/sp500_constituents.csv` â†’ snapshot of current S&P 500 tickers.
  * `docs/universe_notes.md` â†’ notes on inclusion/exclusion (e.g., only currently listed names, corporate actions handling).

---

### **3. Data Source Evaluation**

* **Deliverables:**

  * `docs/data_sources.md` â†’ comparison table of Yahoo, Alpaca, IB, FMP. Include:

    * Coverage (intraday 5-min bars, history length).
    * Reliability (missing data, corrections).
    * API limits & costs.
  * **Plots:** example pull of 5-min OHLCV for 1 ticker across providers to visualize discrepancies.

---

### **4. Constraints & Assumptions**

* **Deliverables:**

  * `config/system_limits.yaml` â†’ defines:

    * Max storage weâ€™ll commit (e.g., 200GB local).
    * Max runtime per job (e.g., 2 hrs for backtest).
    * API call budget (per day/week).
  * `docs/constraints.md` â†’ discussion of what tradeoffs this forces (e.g., 5-min data limited to last 10 years for S&P500 only).

---

### **5. Success Criteria & Risk Management**

* **Deliverables:**

  * `docs/risk_matrix.md` â†’ table with risks + mitigations:

    * **Data Gaps** â†’ cross-check with backup provider.
    * **Compute Overload** â†’ reduce universe, aggregate bars.
    * **Overfitting** â†’ strict walk-forward validation.
  * `docs/strategy_success.md` â†’ describes thresholds for moving forward (e.g., Sharpe > 1.2 net of costs in backtests, stable feature importance across rolling windows).

---

### **6. Project Management Setup**

* **Deliverables:**

  * GitHub repo initialized with:

    * `/docs` â†’ project documentation.
    * `/config` â†’ YAML/JSON configs for parameters.
    * `/data/universe` â†’ ticker lists.
  * `docs/project_timeline.md` â†’ rough phase breakdown (1â€“10) with estimated time per phase.
  * Issue tracker/Trello/Notion setup to assign tasks (even if single-person).

---

# âœ… Phase 1 Completion Checklist

* [ ] Project objectives written & version-controlled.
* [ ] Universe clearly defined & stored.
* [ ] Data providers evaluated with plots + notes.
* [ ] System constraints codified in config.
* [ ] Success metrics + risk matrix finalized.
* [ ] Git repo initialized with docs/config structure.

---

ğŸ‘‰ By the end of Phase 1, weâ€™ll have a **formal blueprint**:

* We know *what weâ€™re solving*, *with what data*, and *under what limits*.
* We have config + docs files so that Phase 2 (Data Acquisition) can be systematic and reproducible.

Do you want me to **draft templates** (like a sample `config/success_metrics.yaml` or `docs/data_sources.md` structure), so you can drop them straight into the repo?



# Phase 3 -  Exploratory Data Analysis Plan â€“ Quant Trading Pro

**Objective:**
Evaluate U.S. equities (S&P 500 initially, intraday 5-min bars, 10 years) along three dimensions: **liquidity, volatility, and trendiness.**
EDA outputs will be used to (1) define feature sets for machine learning models, and (2) model slippage/transaction costs.

---

## 1. **Data Setup**

* **Universe:** Current S&P 500 constituents (survivorship bias noted).
* **Timeframe:** 10 years of intraday 5-min OHLCV bars.
* **Providers:** Interactive Brokers (primary), Yahoo/Alpaca/FMP (secondary).
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Adjust for splits/dividends.
  * Align trading sessions (exclude halts/holidays).
  * Store data in columnar format (Parquet/Feather) for compression.

---

## 2. **Liquidity Analysis**

**Metrics:**

1. **Dollar Volume (DV):**
   [
   DV_t = Close_t \times Volume_t
   ]
   Stored per 5-min bar + daily sum.

2. **Turnover Ratio (TO):**
   [
   TO_t = \frac{Volume_t}{SharesOutstanding}
   ]
   Captures relative liquidity across market caps.

3. **Amihud Illiquidity (ILLIQ):**
   [
   A_t = \frac{|r_t|}{DV_t}, \quad ILLIQ_d = \frac{1}{N_d}\sum_{t=1}^{N_d} A_t
   ]
   where (r_t = \ln(Close_t / Close_{t-1})).
   Stored per 5-min bar + daily average.

**Processing:**

* Store both **raw values** (for slippage modeling) and **cross-sectional normalized values** (z-score or rank per day, for ML features).
* Start with **separate features (DV, TO, Amihud)**; test later whether to combine into a composite liquidity score.

**EDA Tasks:**

* Plot U-shaped intraday liquidity curves.
* Rank stocks daily by liquidity measures.
* Compare sector liquidity distributions.
* Slippage model: approximate cost â‰ˆ (k \times A_t \times TradeSize).

---

## 3. **Volatility Analysis**

**Metrics:**

1. **Realized Volatility (RV):**
   [
   RV_d = \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^{N_d} r_t^2}
   ]
   Use 5-min returns aggregated daily.

2. **Realized Skewness (RS):**
   [
   RS_d = \frac{1}{N_d} \sum_{t=1}^{N_d} \left(\frac{r_t}{RV_d}\right)^3
   ]

3. **Realized Kurtosis (RK):**
   [
   RK_d = \frac{1}{N_d} \sum_{t=1}^{N_d} \left(\frac{r_t}{RV_d}\right)^4
   ]

**Processing:**

* Compute per-day values.
* Normalize cross-sectionally (z-score) for ML comparability.
* Keep raw values for regime/market structure analysis.

**EDA Tasks:**

* Volatility clustering heatmaps across time of day.
* Sector-level volatility comparisons.
* Regime detection: high-vol vs low-vol periods (COVID, 2022 bear).
* Compare daily realized vol with VIX.

---

## 4. **Trendiness Analysis**

**Metrics:**

1. **Rolling Regression Slope (SLOPE):**
   Regression of log-price vs time over rolling multi-day windows (1d, 3d, 5d).
   Coefficient = trend direction; RÂ² = trend strength.

2. **Hurst Exponent (H):**
   ( H > 0.5 ) = persistence/trending; ( H < 0.5 ) = mean-reversion.

3. **Spectral Analysis (SPEC):**
   Fourier/wavelet decomposition of intraday returns to detect periodicities.

4. **PCA Factor Loadings (PCA):**

   * Run PCA on cross-section of returns.
   * Extract top 3 components (market + major sectors).
   * Trendiness = residual alignment/divergence from these latent factors.

**Processing:**

* Store daily aggregates (multi-day windows roll forward).
* Normalize slope/Hurst/PCA loadings cross-sectionally.

**EDA Tasks:**

* Distribution plots of Hurst exponents across stocks.
* Trend persistence histograms (does a 1-day trend extend to 3-day horizon?).
* PCA scatter plots â†’ sector clustering.
* Compare spectral signatures across sectors.

---

## 5. **Bias & Limitation Checks**

* **Survivorship bias:** No delisted stocks â†’ optimistic liquidity/volatility.
* **Lookahead bias:** Ensure all rolling features lagged appropriately.
* **Compute constraint:** 5-min bars Ã— 500 stocks Ã— 10 yrs â‰ˆ 98M rows â†’ requires efficient storage (Parquet) and batch processing.

---

## 6. **Outputs**

1. **Plots:**

   * Liquidity curves, volatility heatmaps, Hurst histograms, PCA clusters.
2. **Tables:**

   * Top/bottom 20 stocks daily by liquidity/volatility/trendiness.
   * Transaction cost estimates by stock and sector.
3. **Feature Library:**

   * Liquidity: Dollar Vol, Turnover, Amihud (raw + normalized, bar + daily).
   * Volatility: Realized vol, skew, kurtosis (raw + normalized).
   * Trendiness: Slope, Hurst, Spectral, PCA (normalized).

---

## 7. **Next Steps After EDA**

* Validate feature stability across regimes.
* Test correlations between features (e.g., liquidity vs volatility).
* Select a **feature set for ML ranking model**.
* Build a **transaction cost function** using Amihud + DV.

---

âœ… This plan balances **advanced quant rigor** (Amihud, Hurst, PCA, spectral) with **retail compute feasibility** (5-min bars, efficient storage).
