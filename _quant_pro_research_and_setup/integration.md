# Quant Trading Pro - Updated Developer-Level Analysis & Implementation Plan

## 1. High-Level Critique (Quant Perspective) - UPDATED

* **Enhanced temporal validation** - Implemented expanding window with 1-year gap between train/test and regime-aware OOS testing using VIX + macroeconomic regime classification
* **Feature stability framework** - Added rolling 6-month feature importance correlation tracking with automated pruning when correlation <0.7
* **Advanced transaction cost modeling** - Expanded beyond Amihud to include bid-ask spread proxies, dynamic slippage scenarios (5/10/20bps), and liquidity-adjusted costs
* **Comprehensive risk management** - Implemented 5% single-stock, 25% sector caps PLUS volatility-adjusted position sizing using 20-day realized volatility
* **Multi-objective model selection** - Clear criteria: IC > 0.02 for development, net Sharpe > 1.0 for production with 3-month rolling validation
* **Sophisticated regime detection** - VIX-based regimes enhanced with Treasury yield curves, market breadth, and economic indicators for robust regime classification
* **Optimized storage strategy** - Store only aggregated daily features, keep raw 5-min data for top-K subset with 30-day rolling window (reduces storage from 3TB to 200GB)
* **Robust backtest validation** - Multiple cost scenarios + corporate action handling + overnight risk modeling
* **Intelligent GPU utilization** - GPU for XGBoost training and large matrix operations, CPU for data loading and preprocessing
* **Comprehensive data quality** - Daily completeness checks (>95% tickers) with automated re-fetch and anomaly detection
