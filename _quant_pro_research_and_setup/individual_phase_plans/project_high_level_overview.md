# **Quant Trading Pro – High-Level Overview**

## **1. Project Goal**

The primary goal of **Quant Trading Pro** is to **develop a systematic, machine learning-driven stock trading system** that can:

1. **Rank U.S. equities daily** based on liquidity, volatility, and trendiness.
2. **Select a top-K subset of stocks** for algorithmic trading and ML modeling.
3. **Predict short-term price movements** and directional trends for these stocks.
4. **Integrate risk and transaction cost considerations** to make realistic trading decisions for retail capital.

The system is designed to be **scalable, modular, and reproducible**, supporting both exploratory research and eventual live trading.

## **2. Core Objectives**

| Objective                          | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stock Ranking**                  | Identify the most promising stocks daily using a combination of cross-sectional metrics (liquidity, volatility, trendiness) and optional screening APIs.     |
| **Feature Engineering for ML**     | Build and validate features from intraday data (5-min bars) to train models for relative ranking and absolute direction prediction.                          |
| **Machine Learning Pipeline**      | Train models on historical top-K stocks, test predictive power, and incorporate feature stability and transaction costs.                                     |
| **Infrastructure & Data Pipeline** | Maintain robust, efficient data acquisition, storage, versioning, and refresh pipelines to ensure reproducibility and reliability.                           |
| **Risk Management**                | Define constraints (capital allocation, drawdowns, sector exposures) and realistic trading assumptions (slippage, transaction costs).                        |
| **Research & EDA**                 | Generate detailed analytics for liquidity, volatility, and trendiness, producing a validated library of ML-ready features.                                   |
| **Scalable Roadmap**               | Phase-based development: Phase 1 (research & scoping), Phase 2 (data acquisition & infrastructure), Phase 3 (EDA & feature prep) with incremental expansion. |

## **3. Project Scope**

1. **Markets & Universe**

   * Start with **S&P 500 equities**, optionally add ETFs.
   * Focus on **current constituents** initially to simplify data handling.

2. **Time Horizon**

   * Target **short-term trades (days)**.
   * Use **intraday 5-min OHLCV data** for ranking, feature engineering, and modeling.
   * Phase 3 may include extended-hours for selected top-K stocks.

3. **Capital & Constraints**

   * Initial modeling assumes **$25k–$100k retail capital**.
   * No leverage initially; margin can be incorporated later.
   * Account for **realistic retail trading costs** (IB/Alpaca commissions, slippage).

4. **Data & Storage**

   * Maintain **raw + cleaned datasets** for reproducibility.
   * Use **Parquet storage**, partitioned by ticker/year.
   * Incremental updates with caching and hash validation for integrity.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * **Strategy**: Sharpe ratio, turnover-adjusted Sharpe, CAGR, max drawdown.
   * **Features**: Rank correlation, Information Coefficient (IC), stability over rolling windows.
   * **Practical**: Liquidity-adjusted returns, transaction cost impact.

## **4. High-Level Workflow**

1. **Phase 1 – Research & Scoping**

   * Define project goals, universe, data sources, constraints, and success metrics.
   * Produce documentation and config files for reproducibility.

2. **Phase 2 – Data Acquisition & Infrastructure**

   * Build modular API connectors (Alpaca, IB, Yahoo, Alpha Vantage).
   * Acquire 5-min OHLCV data, store raw + cleaned datasets.
   * Implement top-K ML subset selection, optional screening API integration, caching, refresh logic, and versioning.

3. **Phase 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis**

   * Compute and analyze **liquidity, volatility, trendiness** metrics.
   * Normalize features for ML.
   * Generate plots, tables, and feature library for ML modeling.
   * Validate stability, correlations, and transaction cost estimates.

4. **Machine Learning & Ranking (Post-Phase 3)**

   * Train models for **relative stock ranking**.
   * Build downstream **absolute prediction models** for trade direction.
   * Backtest strategies incorporating **realistic costs and constraints**.

## **5. Key Principles**

* **Modularity**: Each phase is independent but integrates seamlessly.
* **Scalability**: Designed to handle all S&P 500 equities with 10-year intraday data.
* **Reproducibility**: Metadata versioning, hash checks, logs, and configs ensure experiments can be repeated reliably.
* **Flexibility**: Configurable partitioning, refresh schedules, API sources, top-K selections, and feature engineering.
* **Retail-Friendly**: Compute and storage optimized for personal workstations, with cloud support optional.

## **6. Success Criteria**

1. **Operational**

   * Full 5-min dataset ingested and cleaned.
   * Top-K subset consistently updated and stored.
   * Data pipelines produce reproducible outputs with logs.

2. **Analytical**

   * EDA produces stable, interpretable features for liquidity, volatility, trendiness.
   * Features validated for cross-sectional and rolling-window stability.

3. **Trading / ML**

   * Models trained on top-K subset show positive predictive power (IC, rank correlation).
   * Simulated backtests show Sharpe ratio >1.2 (net of costs) and acceptable drawdowns.
