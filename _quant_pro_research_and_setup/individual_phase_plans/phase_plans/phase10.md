**Phase 10 â€“ Monitoring & Iteration integration plan**

**Objectives & Scope**
The primary goal of Phase 10 is to ensure that Quant Trading Pro operates as a living system rather than a static deployment. This phase emphasizes daily monitoring of both feature behavior and strategy performance (PnL), detecting when inputs or outputs drift from expectations, and implementing a continuous retraining schedule to keep models adaptive. It also opens the door for ongoing research extensions, such as expanding into mid-cap equities, international markets, or incorporating alternative data sources. Deliverables will include monitoring dashboards, alerting systems, retraining playbooks, and documented research pipelines (`docs/phase10_objectives.md`).

**Universe / Asset Selection**
The core asset universe begins with the S&P 500, but Phase 10 is where expansion becomes an explicit objective. Mid-caps, sector-specific ETFs, or international equities may be tested for diversification and robustness. Alternative asset classes (crypto, bonds, commodities) could be included if supported by available infrastructure. Deliverables include updated asset lists (`data/universe/expansion_candidates.csv`) and evaluation reports on new universes. Key considerations involve survivorship bias in extended universes and liquidity thresholds for mid-cap or international stocks.

**Data Sources & APIs**
New universes and alt-data extensions require additional data providers. While core APIs continue handling equities, Phase 10 should evaluate providers for sentiment data, news feeds, or economic indicators. Backup and redundancy remain critical, as data reliability directly impacts drift detection and retraining cycles. Deliverables will include expanded data-source configurations (`config/data_sources.yaml`) and provider comparison reports. Considerations include increased API costs, throttling risks, and standardization across heterogeneous data types.

**Data Acquisition & Storage**
Data ingestion will scale to handle larger universes and more data types. Partitioning by ticker and year remains standard, but Phase 10 introduces monitoring pipelines that check for missing values, delayed feeds, or corrupted partitions. Feature drift detection requires historical snapshots of feature distributions, so storage must retain rolling archives for analysis. Deliverables include ETL monitoring scripts, feature-distribution logs, and expanded storage configurations. Considerations include storage cost trade-offs and the balance between daily and intraday refreshes.

**Feature Engineering / Analysis**
Monitoring feature behavior is central to this phase. Distributional checks, correlation drift, and predictive-power decay must be logged and visualized. Feature sets will need periodic recalibration, particularly when expanding universes or introducing alt-data. Phase 10 should also introduce automated alerts for when feature importance shifts significantly. Deliverables include feature drift reports, IC decay logs, and diagnostic plots in `data/processed/monitoring/`. Considerations involve setting thresholds for retraining triggers without overfitting to noise.

**Infrastructure / Pipeline**
Infrastructure must evolve to support continuous monitoring and retraining. Scheduled jobs will be augmented with alerting systems (email, Slack, or dashboard notifications) to flag anomalies. Retraining pipelines must support both manual and automated runs, with model versioning tied directly to observed drift. Deliverables include retraining pipelines (`src/models/retrain.py`), monitoring dashboards, and alerting integrations. Considerations include preventing excessive retraining, managing compute costs, and ensuring rollback options for new models.

**Evaluation / Success Metrics**
Success in Phase 10 is measured by the stability and adaptability of the system. Metrics include the timeliness of anomaly detection, reduction of unanticipated drawdowns, improved long-term Sharpe ratios, and minimized feature drift impact. PnL monitoring, turnover, and drawdown tracking continue but are now supplemented with operational KPIs like retraining latency and false positive/negative drift alerts. Deliverables include YAML configs for monitoring thresholds and performance scorecards.

**Constraints & Assumptions**
Phase 10 assumes that production pipelines from Phase 9 are stable and can handle expanded data loads. Constraints include compute and storage costs associated with continuous monitoring and retraining, as well as increased reliance on potentially expensive alt-data. Assumptions include access to scalable cloud infrastructure and sufficient research bandwidth to support ongoing model iteration. Deliverables will include resource requirement estimates and cost-control strategies.

**Version Control / Reproducibility**
Every retrained model, feature set, and drift-detection configuration must be versioned in Git and tracked via metadata logs. Continuous monitoring requires reproducible snapshots of model inputs and outputs to backtest any retraining decision. Deliverables include model registries, Git-tracked monitoring configs, and reproducibility reports. Considerations include whether to version full datasets versus storing only metadata hashes and retraining checkpoints.

**Iteration / Next Steps**
Phase 10 sets the foundation for perpetual improvement. Iterations may include integrating reinforcement learning for adaptive strategy updates, expanding research into mid-caps and international universes, and incorporating alt-data into production pipelines. Future steps also involve scaling monitoring systems to near real-time, integrating brokerage APIs for fully automated execution, and building ensemble models for robustness. Deliverables include research backlogs, next-step roadmaps, and updated system diagrams.
