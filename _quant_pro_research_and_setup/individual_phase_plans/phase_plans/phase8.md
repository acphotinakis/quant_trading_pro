# **Phase 8 Integration Plan - Validation & Robustness Checks**

### Objectives & Scope

The primary goal of Phase 8 is to rigorously test the robustness and generalizability of the models and strategies developed in earlier phases. This includes implementing out-of-sample validation, walk-forward testing, feature decay analysis, sensitivity checks across different rebalance frequencies and horizons, and benchmarking against major indices such as the S&P 500 and sector ETFs. Deliverables will include a formal markdown document outlining validation protocols, as well as reproducible scripts to run these checks. The key consideration is ensuring that results are not simply artifacts of historical overfitting, but instead demonstrate consistent predictive power across time and regimes.

### Universe / Asset Selection

The testing universe will remain aligned with the S&P 500 constituents used in prior phases, with dynamic membership to avoid survivorship bias. Additionally, sector-level ETFs will be included as benchmarks to assess relative performance and sector rotation effects. Deliverables include curated CSV lists and documentation of benchmark selection. The open question is whether to expand validation universes to international equities or factor ETFs, which could strengthen robustness but add complexity. For Phase 8, the recommendation is to limit scope to U.S. equities and sector ETFs to maintain alignment with Phase 7 backtests.

### Data Sources & APIs

Validation will use the same historical datasets generated in earlier phases, ensuring consistency with training and backtesting. Benchmarks such as the S&P 500 index and ETFs will be pulled from Yahoo Finance or Alpaca, with backup from Interactive Brokers if needed. Configuration files in `config/data_sources.yaml` will define benchmark tickers and providers. Considerations include API rate limits and ensuring index/ETF data is fully adjusted for dividends and splits. No new providers are required, keeping integration lightweight.

### Data Acquisition & Storage

All data for validation will be retrieved from existing parquet datasets, partitioned by ticker and year, with hash/checksum logs ensuring reproducibility. Benchmark data will be stored in a dedicated subdirectory (`data/benchmarks/`) and versioned similarly. Out-of-sample splits, walk-forward partitions, and feature decay logs will be stored in structured CSVs to facilitate analysis. A decision must be made on whether to retain intermediate walk-forward folds or only store summary statistics. The recommendation is to save both fold-level and aggregate results for transparency.

### Feature Engineering / Analysis

Feature analysis in this phase will focus on **decay and robustness**. Specifically, we will test whether predictive signals such as liquidity, volatility, and trendiness metrics lose explanatory power over time. Rolling IC analysis, decay curves, and stability checks across different market regimes will be performed. Deliverables include plots of feature IC decay, tables of predictive power across time horizons, and CSVs summarizing feature stability. Considerations include whether to apply feature pruning based on stability thresholds or retain weaker features for ensemble diversity.

### Infrastructure / Pipeline

Validation logic will be implemented under `src/validation/`, with modular scripts for walk-forward testing, sensitivity sweeps, and feature decay checks. YAML configuration files will allow users to control horizon lengths, rebalance frequencies, and decay window sizes. Logging will capture fold-level errors and sensitivity outcomes, stored under `logs/validation/`. A key consideration is compute cost, as walk-forward testing can be resource-intensive. To manage this, parallelization will be supported where possible, and subsets of universes can be tested for rapid iteration.

### Evaluation / Success Metrics

Success in this phase will be measured by consistent out-of-sample predictive power and stable performance across validation regimes. Primary metrics include Information Coefficient (IC) stability, Sharpe ratios adjusted for turnover, and maximum drawdown. Secondary metrics include hit rates, feature stability indices, and performance relative to benchmarks. YAML configs will store metric thresholds (e.g., Sharpe > 1.0, IC > 0.02 across folds) as gating criteria for advancing to Phase 9. The key consideration is balancing statistical robustness with practical portfolio outcomes, ensuring that validation results are both mathematically sound and economically meaningful.

### Constraints & Assumptions

Validation assumes the availability of sufficient historical data to support long walk-forward testing windows (10+ years). Retail compute limitations may restrict the number of folds or sensitivity sweeps that can be run in parallel, requiring tradeoffs between thoroughness and runtime. All tests will use RTH-only data for consistency with prior phases, though extended-hours data can be incorporated later. A constraint worth noting is that benchmark comparisons may not fully reflect slippage and execution costs, which must remain aligned with Phase 6 assumptions.

### Version Control / Reproducibility

Every validation run will be tied to specific model hashes, backtest configurations, and benchmark datasets. Metadata and logs will be committed to Git alongside YAML configs that define validation parameters. Outputs such as fold-level IC tables, sensitivity plots, and benchmark comparison charts will be stored with unique run IDs. This ensures that results are reproducible and traceable to specific experimental setups. The consideration is whether to integrate formal experiment tracking tools here; the recommendation is to continue with lightweight YAML + logs until Phase 9, when multiple model ensembles and production readiness require heavier tracking.

### Iteration / Next Steps

The outputs of Phase 8 will directly inform Phase 9, where portfolio optimization and production deployment will occur. By this stage, only models that demonstrate consistent IC, Sharpe, and robustness across validation protocols will move forward. Next steps include documenting validation results, pruning unstable features, and flagging models that fail robustness thresholds for refinement or elimination. Deliverables will include markdown summaries and backlog notes highlighting unresolved questions such as whether to expand universes or incorporate regime-specific models.
